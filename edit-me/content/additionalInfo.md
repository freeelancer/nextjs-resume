A competitive Magic, the Gathering player, I enjoy the strategic depth and ever-evolving world of the game. Participating in tournaments keeps my skills sharp and fosters critical thinking and problem-solving under pressure. These skills translate well to the rigorous nature of software development. I thrive in the ever-changing meta, where strategy constantly evolves with new card releases and shifting player preferences. This experience mirrors the fast-paced world of software development, where keeping up with the latest technologies and adapting to evolving project requirements is crucial.
