I am a passionate blockchain/backend developer specializing in building secure and scalable core as well as DeFi protocols. I am fascinated by the potential of DeFi to unlock new financial frontiers and bring about a new financial revolution. My expertise lies in smart contract development (Solidity, Move, CosmWasm), cross-chain interoperability and Cosmos-sdk blockchains.
