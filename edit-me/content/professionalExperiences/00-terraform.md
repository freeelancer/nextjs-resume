- Implemented dynamic fee functionalities for the Terra blockchain using Cosmos SDK (Golang), enabling congestion control by adjusting transaction fees based on network traffic.
- Developed smart account module using Cosmos SDK (Golang) that gives user the abilities to rotate private keys and add their own logic checks pre and post transactions through smart contracts ([product link](https://github.com/terra-money/core))
- Supported the transition of the Terra blockchain to full community ownership. This involved tasks such as open-sourcing the codebase and facilitating a smooth handover process as TFL winds down.
