- Developed multiple solidity smart contracts used for the staking and reward distribution of a new incentive token (FLUO) which will be launching soon ([product link](https://fluofinance.com/)). Contracts have been audited by OtterSec.
- Spearheaded the development of the CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) module which powered the nitron money market in carbon. It is a combination of the MakerDao model and Aave. Took part in the design process and developed over 70% of the core codebase. ([product link](https://app.dem.exchange/nitron))
- Developed backend codebase from scratch on NodeJs for a relayer service between multiple L1s with two bridging protocols (polynetwork and IBC) that can monitor the latest cross chain transaction information as well as relaying these transactions. ([product link](https://hydrogen.carbon.network/))
- Deployed application lock proxy smart contracts to multiple Layer 1 protocols (BSC, Eth, Arbitrum) and developed the bridging interface for carbon to connect with other L1s. These contracts served as vaults for holding onto tokens bridged into carbon.
