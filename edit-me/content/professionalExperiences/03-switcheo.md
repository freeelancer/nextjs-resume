- Developed and deployed Node.js backend REST servers using both AWS and GCP cloud infrastructure. This included provisioning and managing EC2 instances on AWS and Compute Engine instances on GCP, configuring Nginx for reverse proxying, and utilizing Route 53 for DNS management on AWS.
- Designed and implemented the backend service for a cross-chain indexer using Node.js for efficient processing. The service leverages PostgreSQL for secure and scalable storage of indexed bridging transactions between the Carbon and other Layer 1 blockchains. Additionally, BullMQ is utilized for robust message queuing, ensuring reliable handling of messages during the indexing process. ([product link](https://hydrogen.carbon.network/))
- Designed and built a secure and scalable lending/borrowing module using Cosmos SDK (Golang). While referencing Aave's established functionalities, the implementation diverged due to the inherent differences between the Cosmos SDK and Solidity. ([product link](https://app.dem.exchange/nitron))
- Designed and implemented multiple Solidity smart contracts for a new token with intricate tokenomics. This included functionalities like escrowing, staking, and other features, resulting in a robust and feature-rich token. Contracts have been audited by OtterSec.
- Deployed lockproxy contracts (Solidity) on multiple Layer 1 (BSC, Ethereum, Arbitrum) blockchains to function as secure vaults for token custody on behalf of the Carbon blockchain.
